##about

So I made this little web app to practice. It's a rapid question and answer type app where you can post any question and comment upvotable answers to the questions. But after 40 seconds the question and all the answers are deleted and the next question comes up.

I worked on this during my free periods in high school and a bit at home so it took me about a week to get a functioning product.

More features will be implemented soon

##installation

Use `npm install` to install dependencies (assuming you have node.js installed). `node server` to boot it up!
