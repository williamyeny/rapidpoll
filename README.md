#rapidpoll

I'm new to Express and socket.io so I made this little web app to practice. It's a rapid question and answer type app where you can post any question and comment upvotable answers to the questions. But after 40 seconds the question and all the answers are deleted and the next question comes up.

I worked on this during my free periods in high school and a bit at home so it took me about a week to get a functioning product.

This is my first app deployed and shared so I didn't realize I had to prevent script injection. It was quite the wake-up call.

More features will be implemented soon
